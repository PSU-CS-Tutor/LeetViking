Is this deadly serious? Nah, take your time.

# Project requirement

Here's the requirement I want for this Project so far, I am just laying out the big picture, for the real implementation is really depend on you:

# What's your role?

Working with folks to create a Leetcode-like Online Judge system, to have a way to provide easy to access system for practicing Karla's proficiency demo.

### What's my role?

I will more be like the Product manager, but I will also contribute to the Project.

# Tech Stack (Work in progress)

### Source control: Github organization

### Frontend: React / Angular (I recommand React more. Why? It's the most popular framework atm, and it can also build Android & ios Apps)

### Backend: Spring / JavaScript

### Database: Any

### OAuth: Yes, Google for convenient

### Hosting: Either Firebase or GCP, we can get coupon from School I believe

### Coding environment: You decide

### Backend compiler: Yes, we need some class written, so the student can plug in their solution. They only need to write a function that is in this class. We should have the .h and .cpp ready in the back including the display(), build(), and the class ready

## Outcome?

### Something like [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/)

## Instead of having solution section, I want it to be a place to put a video of us solving the problem instead of giving out real code.

# Layout?
